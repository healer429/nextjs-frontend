          We are not the government we are a 3rd party company here to help
          people with the application process. We come from a background of
          business experts who wanted to be able to help other people start
          their businesses. And we know the first step to starting your business
          is to become a legitimate business in the eyes of the government.

          We started the service to make the process of beginning your journey
          into the entrepreneurial world a little easier. With all of the
          options and possibilities to make a mistake and deter you from
          starting your business before you’ve even helped your first customer,
          we wanted to make sure that doesn’t happen.

          Many of the people who work here have a background in business
          consulting in this business was started because we saw a need with
          helping new businesses to get established properly and then set up for
          success and profitability.
