                    We are not the government we are a 3rd party company here to help
                    people with the application process. We come from a background of
                    business experts who wanted to be able to help other people start
                    their businesses. And we know the first step to starting your business
                    is to become a legitimate business in the eyes of the government.

                    We started the service to make the process of beginning your journey
                    into the entrepreneurial world a little easier. With all of the
                    options and possibilities to make a mistake and deter you from
                    starting your business before you’ve even helped your first customer,
                    we wanted to make sure that doesn’t happen.

                    Many of the people who work here have a background in business
                    consulting in this business was started because we saw a need with
                    helping new businesses to get established properly and then set up for
                    success and profitability.
