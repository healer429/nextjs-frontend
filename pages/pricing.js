          checked and submitted to IRS error-free. We advise you on how to

          a private company not affiliated with the government. We charge a fee
          for our application form service. You can apply for your ein number
          directly with the IRS at no cost at www.irs.gov, however, you will

          first-class support service. As a part of our service all our our
