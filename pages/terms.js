            Cancellation.
            <p>
              When you place an order through the Services, your order begins
              processing immediately. Due to the varying nature of processing
              times, you may request cancellation after your order has been
              placed but we cannot guarantee that your order will be canceled.
              You may be able to cancel your order for the Services if your
              order has not begun processing and you contact us within one (1)
              hour of placing your order via email at support@ein-forms-gov.com
              or by calling 888-478-9961. Upon successful cancellation we will
              refund your order in full to the original form of payment.

          <li>
            Refunds.
            <p>
              Once we have begun processing or completed your order, such as by
              submitting an application to the IRS on your behalf or by
              obtaining a service through the IRS on your behalf, your order
              cannot be canceled. In the event a cancellation request is
              received after the eligible cancellation period but within (7)
              calendar days of placing your order, a partial refund may be
              issued depending on the nature of your order and our progress in
              completing it:
            </p>
            <p>
              - If we have begun processing your order but have not yet
              completed the services, we may refund 50% of your payment amount.
            </p>
            <p>
              - If we have completed your order, such as by submitting the
              application to the IRS but an EIN number has not yet been issued
              or a service has not been obtained from the IRS on your behalf, we
              may refund 50% of your payment amount.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once your EIN number has been issued or service has been obtained
              from the IRS on your behalf a refund is not available.
